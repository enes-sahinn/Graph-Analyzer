## About The Project
This project aims to create a directed graph whose directions are constructed from ‘source’ to ‘destination’ with the given ‘edge-weight’ 
value by reading the file named as "graph.txt", then answer the 3 quesitons below.

The program asks the user for a source and a destination name. Then the code will run to find maximum number of packages can be transferred from 
source to destination branches provided by the user.

Main Tasks:\
1- What is the maximum number of packages that can be transferred from source to destination in one day?\
2- Which edges’ capacity should be increased at first to increase the number of received packages at the destination branch?\
3- How much should we maximize these edges found in the task 2?

## Used Algorithms
* Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm
* Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem
* Breadth First Search
* Depth First Search
